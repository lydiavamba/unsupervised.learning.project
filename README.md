Unsupervised Learning Project 🧠📊

This project explores how unsupervised machine learning can be used to find hidden patterns in data without using labeled answers. By applying clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, we group similar data points and visualize their relationships.

📂 Project Overview Notebook: Unsupervised Learning.ipynb

Goal: Discover structure in datasets and group similar items using unsupervised learning methods.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Algorithms Used: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE

⚙️ Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Cleaned the dataset and handled missing values

Scaled features for better algorithm performance

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized data distributions and patterns using histograms and scatter plots

Checked correlations between features

Modeling

Applied clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)

Used PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization

Evaluation

Used silhouette score and visual plots to check clustering quality

📈 Results

Each method’s results were visualized to show group separation and data structure. PCA and t-SNE helped reveal clear clusters in a reduced-dimensional space.
